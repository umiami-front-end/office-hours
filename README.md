# Online Office Hours

*When you schedule an appointment for the first time, please schedule two consecutive blocks.* This will allow some time to work out any hiccups with the software before actually getting to your questions.

Please have the following software installed before your appointment -- especially if you intend to have me look over code.

- [Microsoft Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com/downloads)
- [Atom](https://atom.io)
- [Teletype](https://teletype.atom.io/) plug-in (for Atom)


## Microsoft Teams

[Microsoft Teams](http://teams.microsoft.com) facilitates chat, audio and video communication.

To use an audio connection, [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge) or the Microsoft Teams desktop application are required.

1. Open the Microsoft Teams desktop application. In the left column, click Chat.

2. If you have a scheduled appointment with me, you should see my name in the left-hand Chat column under Recents. Send a  message when you are ready. I will initiate the audio call.


## Teletype

[Teletype](https://teletype.atom.io/) is a plug-in for the [Atom](https://atom.io/) code editor which permits remote collaboration on code.

### Installing Teletype

1. Log in to [GitHub](https://github.com/).

2. In Atom, install the Teletype plug-in. Go to Atom > Preferences. In the Settings tab, select Install. Search for Teletype. Click the blue Install button.

3. Once Teletype is installed, an antenna icon will appear in the status bar (bottom right). When you click the icon, a module will appear which provides a link to [teletype.atom.io/login](teletype.atom.io/login).

4. You will be redirected to your browser, which will load a page asking for your authorization. Click the green button, Authorize Atom.

5. After authorization, you will be given a unique token. Click Copy token.

6. Return to Atom and click the antenna icon. Paste the token you just copied into the form field. Click the blue "Sign In" button.


### Establishing a Connection

1. Click the antenna icon. You should see a module which displays the icon associated with your GitHub account on the top left and a Share switch on the top right. Below both is a link to Join Portal.

2. Open the files in Atom which you want to work on. Close any unnecessary tabs.

3. Click the Share switch. This will generate a unique link for collaborators to join. Click the Copy button.

4. In Microsoft Teams, paste the link you just copied into the  chat window.

5. Once a connection is established, you should your collaborator's icon in the bottom right of the window. Click each tab in your Atom window. This will allow those tabs to display in the Atom window of your collaborator.
